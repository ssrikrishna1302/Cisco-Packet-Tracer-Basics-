## Network Setup
Devices Used:
- 1 Switch (Switch0)
- 2 PCs (PC0 and PC1)

Connections:
- PC0 connected to Switch0 using a copper straight-through cable.
- PC1 connected to Switch0 using another copper straight-through cable.

IP Addressing:
- PC0 → 192.168.1.10, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0  
- PC1 → 192.168.1.11, Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

## Configuration Steps
1. Place one switch and two PCs in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Connect each PC to the switch using straight-through cables.
3. Assign the above IP addresses to both PCs.
4. Open the Command Prompt on PC0 and type:
